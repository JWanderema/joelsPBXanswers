Vulnerabilities Discovered

The type of vulnerabilities I have discovered in real world applications are such as username enumerations, XSS, SQL injections, LDAP injections, cross site request forgery and security misconfigurations.

One method I used to find these are Running Vulnerability scans through Nessus and testing those holes using dedicated applications like Core Impact. 

In this app I import data from Nessus Vulnerability scanner which pulls all the targeted hosts. I then select a penetration module and run it against a host, Impact then looks at the vulnerability scan results, goes through a list of all the vulnerabilities associated with each host, match up the exploits and impact that match the vulnerability scan and executes the exploits. A report is then generated which shows the result of the exploits.

I then generate a vulnerability validation report. This report shows successful and failed exploits detailing CVSS information against each exploit successful and non-successful. 

Impact then uses the potential vulnerabilities that have been identified by the scanner to find any confirmed risk in the web app.

When confirmed, I then leverage the vulnerability be it XSS agent or another, to run in a sand box to see what it does. The result is what I would use as my proof of concept. 

I did not receive a bug bounty-payment for them. However, I developed a go-to relationship with those who see me as an asset, which I find valuable.
